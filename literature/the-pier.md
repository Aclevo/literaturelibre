# The pier - 10/07/21
Jack grasped his ears with bludgeoning force. "Make it stop, make it stop!" Jack shrieked. The kid began convulsing on the floor, tears streaming down his pain-stricken face. Pedestrians glared at the young boy and likely assumed he was having a temper-tantrum. Jack shriveled on the floor, clutching his chest from the unbearable, seering, burning pain that was expanding within him. Just before the pain felt like it would kill him it suddenly ceased. Jack wiped his tears, got up and walked away from the pier.

The boat rippled waves into the calm, peaceful ocean. Sparrows, woodpeckers and pigeons made the beginnings of an opera. The woodpeckers drummed into the wood with their beaks, carving their beat into the tree. The sparrows provided the quiet, soothing choir. The pigeons were the main vocals, utilizing their loud nature to aid the symphony. Their song could be heard all around, singing serenity into the air. An army of trees on the horizon gazed at the birds in awe, listening to nature's song with glee. 

Detective Phipps stepped onto the boat, making his presence known to every object in a 12 meter radius, to meet the other detective. Phipps was dismayed at the number of missing persons reports.
 "This is the 12th person who has gone missing this year." Phipps stated, in disarray. Detective Santiago glanced at Phipps, "I suppose it could potentially be a murder case, but that seems unlikely in the small town, 12 people is too large of a number..." 
Phipps ignited the boat, which gave a lion-like roar as it spluttered to life. "We should really start scanning the bottom of the lake for bodies" Santiago suggested.

Hours passed on the boat, the fish net they were using to find the bodies having no such luck. The water was giving the fish-net a loving brush before moving through it. Phipps and Santiago discussed the case for hours on end, and with each passing minute their minds poked more doubts into the integrity of the case. Despite the integrity of the case being jeopardised, Santiago still grew seemingly more convinced something larger was at play.

The boat was parked on the pier, the two parted ways with a longful embrace, romance in the workplace was something the couple could never get used to. Phipps walked back to his home, meanwhile Santiago rested on a bench, next to the pier. 

Santiago shrieked and convulsed on the floor. She gripped her ears with bludgeoning force. "S-stop!" she repeatedly murmured. This has happened before, although never to this intensity. Tears ran down her face as she lay on the floor, helpless, clutching her burning chest.
The voice ceased, and Santiago stood up.
She walked over onto the pier and looked down at the lake below, tears streaming down her face. She could see the light down below the bottom of the river. Without hesitation she jumped and fell through to the frozen lake of cocytus. Santiago's body seized up, although her body no longer began to her. With a ripping force her soul was ejected from her body which is now a lifeless husk, at the bottom of the lake.
