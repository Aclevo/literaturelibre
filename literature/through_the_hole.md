# Through The Hole - 30/09/2019
Laying in my bedroom, I find a pretty small hole in the wall

where the lovely landscape of forests, meadows, and grassland reside.

Where such true freedom and love in the nice breeze flows,

throughout my mind, my body full of tranquility and hopefulness.

This peaceful land that the lord God has made for me, untouched

by a single soul, where there is truthfully only pure beauty and love.

Only to be seen in this hole in the wall, such green scenery and wonderful

nature, a beautiful heaven where the trees wave their leaves back and forth.

Oh, What such a wonderful hole to look through.Laying in my bedroom, I find a pretty small hole in the wall

Oh, What such a wonderful hole to look through.
