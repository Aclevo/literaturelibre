# Colorful Waves - 03/10/2019
In those deep seas where the waves sway up and down their path,

the color blue stretches out for my eyes can see, in my special boat.

From out in the middle of nowhere, all the way to the dock which I park,

the beautiful green choral, the beaches, yet also has such peace with the

sound of the rocking up and down, back and forth so gently and quietly.

Those wonderful powerful waves ride me through the days and the nights,

washing away the remains of old sailors threw over the shameful plank.

Through those waves is where I park my very special red anchor, the

one that only God himself made special for me and no one else.
