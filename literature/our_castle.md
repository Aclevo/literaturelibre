# Our Castle - 12/05/2021
 Our castle is being attacked at the core yet again

seeing signs of crumble

falling from the outside

and fecal matter spreading onto the

once clean walls.

No one is there to clean the mess and sewer that

 rots in the daylight, nor the rainstorms

 that trench the castle.

The king sends his men to the deformation to no avail,

hearing on empty responses,

alas just a simple plain field.

Not even a single soul there to  

stand the grounds in case of

invasion. Not even a single soul to

 take care of the ill-ridden king.

Just a castle in a field  

that calls yet  

hears nothing in it’s return.



Castle habitants walk slowly

 in their pale skins and faint legs

wondering a day where

 they will once again feel strong and power.

The pain reveals flashbacks

 of the previous wars where the barracks

struggle to defend our castle.

Arms and nukes once obliberating it, yet

people coming together with the resources to rebuild,

 forgetting the sight of the insides

 with decay.

Perhaps only for the king’s pleasure they had

barely restored the external walls,

 barely holding the stone it was left.

It seems as if the remains  

of the once precious lively kingdom remain.

They – the habitants, were so young,

 strong, and lively ready for anything,

everything that they would need

 to protect their home – our castle.
