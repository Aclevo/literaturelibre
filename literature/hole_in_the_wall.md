# Hole In The Wall - 28/03/2021
Hole in the wall

never to show any sign of escape

Filling with light of the skies and the sun

shining through with it’s own warmness

Tempting the inhabitant to look

and watch the springtime bloom

The flowers and the trees grow themselves

with pretty stems, pedals, and leaves of

beautiful warm weather to come

Making them smile and sense true liberty

from the starving chilliness of wintertime

April is arriving soon with heat and temperature

that possedes against the earlier March chill

Begging them to ask what scortching summertime

will dehydrate the disbelievers of their sweat

and cook them into precious human flesh

Yet such a hot wave of air is to come for months

leaving sighs of relief for those who it cannot stand

The peaceful sound of the rain and puddles form joy

and calming love, just to watch from the hole in the wall

that provides protection from the wilderness outdoors

Yet it only shows itself just partially unlike the door

that remains shut with no chance of being opened til

the day comes of the great exploration of the green lush

One would wonder how the creation of that small speck

came to be, whether through someone using a drill which

almost sounds impossible for the insider to comprehend

No, it couldn’t be driven by somebody else from the one’s

eyes can see by the way it looks and is formed

Weather simply does not have a rhythm nor does it have

a motive, yet it is something that simply exists

for possible enjoyment thanks to him, our creator

The theory of expandification or shrinking of the hole

will never be known by the only insider who just stares

and simply accepts it regardless of shape, size, and purpose

Nothing can be known about the man inside for he

remains to be unknown, having no identification nor insight

as to what is exactly happening outside of his existance

But the lush greenery just standing outside being dormant,

nevertheless also vivant. Out in the middle of nowhere feels

like a location that actually isn’t nowhere by paradox

Surely it is, however, a place to relax and take in the beauty,

and it is non-voluntarily non-disagreeable for the insider.
